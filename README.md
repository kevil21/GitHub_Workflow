# Git Workflow Demo

This repository was created as part of a practical exercise to demonstrate core Git and GitHub workflows using **Terminal** and **GitHub Desktop**.

## Task Overview

### **Task 1 — Create & Publish Repository**
- Created a new local repository named `git-workflow-demo`
- Added this `README.md` file
- Made the first commit
- Published the repository to GitHub

### **Task 2 — Branching & Feature Work**
- Created a new branch named `feature-ui`
- Modified files (e.g., updated README or added HTML file)
